Sqsh was originally written by Scott C. Gray. Scott did all the work through
release 2.1.

Sqsh is currently maintained by Michael Peppler (mpeppler@peppler.org) and
Martin Wesdorp (mwesdorp@users.sourceforge.net).  Releases 2.1.2 through 2.1.5
were mainly covered by Michael. Releases 2.1.6 up to 2.5 include a lot of code
contributions and bug fixes by Martin.

It is our main goal to keep sqsh's features and behavior in sync with the
SAP Sybase's isql and bcp utilities.

A big thank you to all the users of Sqsh who have reported problems,
have contributed their bug fixes and patches or have offered new functionality to
the project and thus helped us to make Sqsh what it is today, a very valuable
productivity tool for the demanding SAP Sybase ASE, RepServer, IQ or
Microsoft SQL Server DBA.
